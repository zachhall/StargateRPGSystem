# StargateRPGSystem

This is a fork of Filip Sardovky's Stargate RPG project for my own educational purposes. If you're interested in playing with or developing for the Stargate RPG system on Foundry, please refer to his original project and support him there: https://github.com/sadovsf/StargateRPGSystem
